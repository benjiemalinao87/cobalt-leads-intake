# Lessons Learned

## Admin Dashboard Implementation

### Successful Implementation Patterns
- **Component Separation**: Created separate components for different parts of the UI (Navbar, Admin page, etc.) to maintain clean code and make future updates easier.
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented responsive design patterns using Tailwind CSS, making the admin dashboard work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Mock Data Pattern**: Used mock data with the same structure as expected from the API to develop and test the UI before connecting to actual backend services.
- **Reusable UI Components**: Leveraged the existing UI component library (shadcn) to maintain consistency and speed up development.

### Potential Issues to Avoid
- **Large Table Performance**: When dealing with large datasets, ensure pagination is implemented to prevent performance issues.
- **HTTP Requests**: In a production environment, ensure proper error handling for API requests and implement loading states.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Tables can be difficult to display on mobile devices - consider alternative layouts for smaller screens.

### Integration Best Practices
- For a complete integration, replace the mock data fetch with actual API calls
- Consider implementing a React Query fetch hook for data fetching and caching
- Make sure to handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

### Security Considerations
- Admin pages should be protected with proper authentication
- Consider implementing role-based access control for different admin capabilities
- Ensure sensitive data is properly handled and not exposed unnecessarily

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement virtual scrolling or pagination for large datasets
- Use memoization for expensive calculations or filtering operations
- Consider debouncing search inputs to prevent excessive filtering on each keystroke

## Supabase Integration

### Database Schema Design
- **Thoughtful Schema Planning**: Carefully designed the leads table with all necessary fields from the form, plus additional fields for tracking routing and webhook status.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Used snake_case for database fields to match PostgreSQL conventions, while keeping camelCase in the frontend code.
- **Comprehensive Indexes**: Added indexes on commonly queried fields (email, city, lead_source, etc.) to improve query performance.

### Lead Routing Implementation
- **Multi-level Routing Logic**: Implemented a hierarchical routing approach: first try city-based rules, then fall back to percentage-based distribution.
- **Routing Logs**: Created separate logs for routing decisions, making it easier to audit and debug the assignment process.
- **Flexible Routing Rules**: Designed the system to support different types of routing rules (geography, source, random distribution) that can be adjusted without code changes.

### Integration Challenges
- **Data Syncing**: Ensured data is stored in Supabase first, then sent to the webhook, with status tracking to handle potential webhook failures.
- **Database Relationships**: Properly set up foreign key relationships between leads, sales reps, and routing rules to maintain data integrity.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling for database operations to prevent partial submissions.

### Real-time Updates
- **State Management**: Ensured the UI reflects the current state of the database by implementing a refresh mechanism with proper loading indicators.
- **Data Transformation**: Carefully transformed database field names to match frontend component expectations.

### Future Considerations
- Consider implementing real-time subscriptions for instant updates when new leads are added
- Add proper authentication and authorization for admin access
- Develop a more sophisticated routing algorithm based on sales rep performance and specialization
