# Lessons Learned

## Admin Dashboard Implementation

### Successful Implementation Patterns
- **Component Separation**: Created separate components for different parts of the UI (Navbar, Admin page, etc.) to maintain clean code and make future updates easier.
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented responsive design patterns using Tailwind CSS, making the admin dashboard work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Mock Data Pattern**: Used mock data with the same structure as expected from the API to develop and test the UI before connecting to actual backend services.
- **Reusable UI Components**: Leveraged the existing UI component library (shadcn) to maintain consistency and speed up development.

### Potential Issues to Avoid
- **Large Table Performance**: When dealing with large datasets, ensure pagination is implemented to prevent performance issues.
- **HTTP Requests**: In a production environment, ensure proper error handling for API requests and implement loading states.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Tables can be difficult to display on mobile devices - consider alternative layouts for smaller screens.

### Integration Best Practices
- For a complete integration, replace the mock data fetch with actual API calls
- Consider implementing a React Query fetch hook for data fetching and caching
- Make sure to handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

### Security Considerations
- Admin pages should be protected with proper authentication
- Consider implementing role-based access control for different admin capabilities
- Ensure sensitive data is properly handled and not exposed unnecessarily

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement virtual scrolling or pagination for large datasets
- Use memoization for expensive calculations or filtering operations
- Consider debouncing search inputs to prevent excessive filtering on each keystroke

## Supabase Integration

### Database Schema Design
- **Thoughtful Schema Planning**: Carefully designed the leads table with all necessary fields from the form, plus additional fields for tracking routing and webhook status.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Used snake_case for database fields to match PostgreSQL conventions, while keeping camelCase in the frontend code.
- **Comprehensive Indexes**: Added indexes on commonly queried fields (email, city, lead_source, etc.) to improve query performance.

### Lead Routing Implementation
- **Multi-level Routing Logic**: Implemented a hierarchical routing approach: first try city-based rules, then fall back to percentage-based distribution.
- **Routing Logs**: Created separate logs for routing decisions, making it easier to audit and debug the assignment process.
- **Flexible Routing Rules**: Designed the system to support different types of routing rules (geography, source, random distribution) that can be adjusted without code changes.

### Integration Challenges
- **Data Syncing**: Ensured data is stored in Supabase first, then sent to the webhook, with status tracking to handle potential webhook failures.
- **Database Relationships**: Properly set up foreign key relationships between leads, sales reps, and routing rules to maintain data integrity.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling for database operations to prevent partial submissions.

### Real-time Updates
- **State Management**: Ensured the UI reflects the current state of the database by implementing a refresh mechanism with proper loading indicators.
- **Data Transformation**: Carefully transformed database field names to match frontend component expectations.

### Future Considerations
- Consider implementing real-time subscriptions for instant updates when new leads are added
- Add proper authentication and authorization for admin access
- Develop a more sophisticated routing algorithm based on sales rep performance and specialization

## SugarCRM API Integration

### Token Management
- **Local Storage for Development**: Used browser's localStorage for token storage, which is suitable for development but should be replaced with more secure methods in production.
- **Token Refresh**: Implemented automatic token refresh before expiry to maintain continuous access to the API.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Created fallback to password-based authentication if token refresh fails, ensuring API access is maintained.
- **Error Recovery**: Built error recovery mechanisms to handle API connection issues, reducing failures visible to end users.

### API Implementation Patterns
- **Service Layer Abstraction**: Created a dedicated service layer (sugarcrm.ts) to handle API communication, keeping business logic separate from data fetching.
- **Status Tracking**: Added fields in the database to track API submission status, providing visibility into the entire submission flow.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Designed the system to continue functioning even if SugarCRM API is temporarily unavailable, with appropriate retry mechanisms.
- **Data Transformation**: Handled the mapping between our application's data model and SugarCRM's expected format in a centralized location.

### Security Considerations
- **Credentials Security**: In a production environment, API credentials should be stored server-side, not in client-side code.
- **Token Security**: Implemented token expiration handling to minimize the risk of token misuse.
- **Minimal Permissions**: SugarCRM API tokens should be requested with minimal necessary permissions following the principle of least privilege.

### Integration Testing
- **Parallel Submissions**: Tested scenarios where multiple external systems (Supabase, webhook, SugarCRM) needed to be updated with the same data.
- **Error Cases**: Thoroughly tested what happens when one system is available but others are not, ensuring data integrity.
- **Token Renewal**: Verified that token renewal works correctly across different scenarios, including expiration and invalid tokens.

## Supabase and SugarCRM Integration Lessons

### Integration Architecture
- **Dual Integration Pattern**: The lead intake system uses both Supabase for internal data storage and SugarCRM as an external CRM system. This dual integration provides redundancy and ensures lead data is preserved even if one system fails.
- **Error Isolation**: Failures in SugarCRM integration do not cause the entire submission process to fail. The system records the error in Supabase and allows the process to continue with webhook submission.
- **Status Tracking**: Integration status is tracked with fields like `api_sent`, `api_response_id`, and `api_response_data` in the Supabase database.

### Authentication Handling
- **Token Management**: SugarCRM integration uses OAuth2 with password grant and refresh token flows. Tokens are stored with expiry tracking to minimize authentication requests.
- **Credentials Security**: Hard-coded credentials in the codebase (such as the SugarCRM username/password) should be moved to environment variables or a secret management system.
- **Token Refresh Strategy**: The code implements a cascading authentication strategy where refresh tokens are tried first, falling back to password authentication if refresh fails.

### Data Synchronization
- **One-way Integration**: Currently implemented as a one-way push from the intake form to both Supabase and SugarCRM, without bidirectional synchronization.
- **Field Mapping**: The SugarCRM API requires field names that differ from our internal schema (e.g., `first_name` vs `firstName`). Maintaining clear mapping documentation is essential when working with external systems.
- **Partial Updates**: When updating integration status in Supabase, only the necessary fields are updated to minimize write operations.

### Lead Routing Logic
- **Multi-level Routing**: The system implements a hierarchical routing approach that first checks city-specific rules and then falls back to percentage-based distribution.
- **Routing Transparency**: All routing decisions are logged with supporting data (method, criteria, random values) to ensure transparency and auditability.
- **Routing Idempotency**: Routing decisions are made once and stored with the lead to ensure consistency if operations need to be retried.

### Error Handling Strategies
- **Graceful Degradation**: The system continues to function even when external integrations fail, prioritizing data preservation in Supabase.
- **Error Logging**: Detailed error information is captured in Supabase, enabling troubleshooting without losing customer data.
- **Recovery Path**: The system is designed to allow manual or automated recovery processes for leads that failed to sync with SugarCRM.

### Security Considerations
- **Supabase Anonymous Key**: The current implementation uses an anonymous key for Supabase, which should be restricted in production to only allow the specific operations needed.
- **Data Minimization**: Consider whether all lead fields need to be sent to SugarCRM or if a subset would be sufficient.
- **API Exposure**: The SugarCRM API integration happens server-side to prevent exposing credentials in client-side code.

### Performance Optimizations
- **Parallel Processing**: The webhook submission and SugarCRM integration could potentially be executed in parallel rather than sequentially to improve performance.
- **Batch Processing**: For future high-volume scenarios, consider implementing batch processing for SugarCRM integration.
- **Connection Pooling**: The Supabase client is instantiated once at the module level to enable connection reuse.

### Future Considerations
- **Webhook Reliability**: Consider implementing a retry mechanism for webhook submissions to increase reliability.
- **Queue-based Architecture**: For production environments with high volume, consider moving to a queue-based architecture to handle SugarCRM integration separately from the main submission flow.
- **Audit Trail**: Expand the logging system to create a comprehensive audit trail of all integration activities.

## CORS Issues with External API Integration

### Problem Identification
- **CORS Blocking**: Direct browser-to-API calls to SugarCRM were blocked by CORS policy
- **Error Message**: "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource"
- **Failed Authentication**: Unable to obtain OAuth tokens due to CORS restrictions

### Solution Implementation
- **Backend Proxy Required**: External API calls to systems like SugarCRM should be made from a server-side component
- **Implementation Options**:
  1. Create a dedicated proxy endpoint in a Node.js/Express server
  2. Use serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions, etc.)
  3. Implement API routes in a framework like Next.js
  4. **Use Supabase Edge Functions** (our chosen solution)

### Supabase Edge Functions Solution
- **Edge Functions**: By creating a Supabase Edge Function that handles the SugarCRM API calls, we avoid CORS restrictions completely
- **Benefits**:
  1. No need for a separate server infrastructure
  2. Fast global deployment closer to users
  3. Better security by keeping credentials out of client-side code
  4. Built-in development tools with the Supabase CLI

#### Edge Function Implementation
```typescript
// SugarCRM proxy Edge Function example
serve(async (req) => {
  try {
    // Get the lead data from the request
    const leadData = await req.json();
    
    // Get a token directly from the Edge Function
    const token = await getToken();
    
    // Make the API call from the Edge Function
    const result = await createLead(leadData, token);
    
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(result), {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
      }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: error.message }), {
      status: 500,
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
      }
    });
  }
});
```

#### Frontend Implementation
```typescript
// Simplified client code that calls the Edge Function
export const createLead = async (leadData: any): Promise<any> => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post(EDGE_FUNCTION_URL, leadData);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating lead:', error);
    throw new Error('Failed to create lead');
  }
};
```

### Architectural Lessons
- **Client-Server Separation**: Authentication with external systems should happen server-side
- **Security Improvement**: Moving OAuth credentials to server-side code prevents exposure in browser
- **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling in the proxy service

### Implementation Example
```javascript
// Server-side proxy endpoint example (Express.js)
app.post('/api/proxy/sugarcrm/leads', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const token = await getValidToken(); // Server-side token management
    const response = await axios.post('https://cobalt.sugarondemand.com/rest/v11/Leads', 
      req.body,
      {
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'OAuth-Token': token
        }
      }
    );
    res.json(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating lead in SugarCRM:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to create lead in SugarCRM' });
  }
});
```

### Interim Solution: CORS Proxy
- For development/testing, a CORS proxy service can be used temporarily
- Consider using browser extensions like "CORS Unblock" for local development only
- Note that production systems should always implement proper backend proxy solutions

#### CORS Proxy Implementation
- **Public CORS Proxy**: We used a public CORS proxy (https://corsproxy.io/) to bypass CORS restrictions
- **How it works**: The proxy adds appropriate CORS headers to the responses
- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  // Using a CORS proxy to make API calls
  const CORS_PROXY = 'https://corsproxy.io/?';
  const SUGAR_API_URL = 'https://cobalt.sugarondemand.com/rest/v11';
  
  // Make API call through the proxy
  const response = await axios.post(
    `${CORS_PROXY}${SUGAR_API_URL}/endpoint`, 
    requestData,
    {
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'OAuth-Token': token
      }
    }
  );
  ```

#### CORS Proxy Limitations
- **Security Risks**: Your API requests are passing through a third-party service
- **Rate Limiting**: Public proxies may have usage limits
- **Reliability**: Depends on the availability of the third-party service
- **Not for Production**: Should only be used during development/testing

## SugarCRM API Integration CORS Issues

### Problem
When making direct requests to the SugarCRM API from the frontend, we encountered CORS errors:
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://corsproxy.io/?https://cobalt.sugarondemand.com/rest/v11/oauth2/token' from origin 'http://localhost:8080' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: It does not have HTTP ok status.
```

### Root Cause
1. The SugarCRM API does not have CORS headers configured to allow requests from our frontend domain
2. Initial CORS proxy solution (cors-anywhere) was not working correctly with our specific API
3. Missing proper headers in the requests

### Solution
1. Changed the CORS proxy from cors-anywhere to corsproxy.io:
   ```javascript
   // Old proxy:
   const CORS_PROXY = 'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/';
   
   // New proxy:
   const CORS_PROXY = 'https://corsproxy.io/?';
   ```

2. Updated request headers to include proper 'Origin' and 'Accept' headers:
   ```javascript
   headers: {
     'Content-Type': 'application/json',
     'Accept': 'application/json',
     'Origin': window.location.origin
   }
   ```

3. Removed the 'X-Requested-With' header which was specific to the cors-anywhere proxy

4. Implemented a fallback mechanism to use the Supabase Edge Function when the CORS proxy fails:
   ```javascript
   export const createLead = async (leadData: any): Promise<any> => {
     try {
       // First try with CORS proxy
       try {
         // Original CORS proxy approach
         // ...
       } catch (corsError) {
         console.error('CORS proxy approach failed:', corsError);
         
         // Fallback to Edge Function
         return await createLeadViaEdgeFunction(leadData);
       }
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error creating lead in SugarCRM (all methods failed):', error);
       throw new Error('Failed to create lead in SugarCRM');
     }
   };
   ```

5. Added more robust error handling and logging in the frontend form submission:
   - Added detailed error logging
   - Saved error details to Supabase for debugging
   - Improved user feedback on errors
   - Enhanced webhook error handling as an additional fallback

### Best Practice for Production
For production environments, it's better to use a proper backend proxy or serverless function (like Supabase Edge Functions) to make these API calls, rather than relying on public CORS proxies.

The ideal solution is to implement the SugarCRM API calls in our Supabase Edge Function (`sugar-crm-proxy`) which already has proper CORS configurations set up. This approach is more secure and reliable than using public CORS proxies.

## User Authentication UI Improvements

### Logout Button Implementation
- **Problem**: The application had login functionality but was missing a visible logout option, making it difficult for users to sign out.
- **Solution**: Added a logout button to the Navbar component with the following implementation:
  1. Imported the `logout` function from the auth library
  2. Added a conditional render based on the user's authentication state
  3. Used a ghost button variant with LogOut icon for better UX
  4. Made the button responsive by hiding text on mobile but keeping the icon

#### Implementation Details
- **Authentication Check**: Used `getCurrentMember()` to determine if user is logged in
- **UI Components**: Used Shadcn UI Button component with Lucide icons
- **Responsive Design**: Added `hidden sm:inline` to the text label to hide it on small screens
- **Placement**: Positioned in the navbar next to the theme toggle for consistency

#### Code Pattern
```tsx
// Navbar component excerpt
const Navbar: React.FC = () => {
  const member = getCurrentMember();
  
  return (
    // ... existing navbar code ...
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
      {member && (
        <Button 
          variant="ghost" 
          size="sm" 
          onClick={() => logout()}
          className="flex items-center gap-2"
        >
          <LogOut size={16} />
          <span className="hidden sm:inline">Logout</span>
        </Button>
      )}
      <ThemeToggle />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Authentication Flow Improvements
- **Consistent UI State**: The navbar now properly reflects the user's authentication state
- **User Experience**: Users have a clear, accessible way to log out from any page
- **Security Practice**: Providing an explicit logout option is a security best practice
- **Design Consistency**: Maintained the application's design language by using existing UI components

### Future Enhancements
- Consider adding a confirmation dialog for logout to prevent accidental clicks
- Implement proper token invalidation on the server side when logged out
- Add visual feedback (toast notification) when logout is successful 

## Lead Management UI Improvements

### Data Table Design
- **Information Density**: Finding the right balance of information density is crucial for data tables. Too much data makes tables overwhelming, while too little makes them less useful.
- **Default Visibility**: Set sensible default column visibility to show the most important data by default, with options to expand when needed.
- **Consistent Styling**: Applied consistent styling for status indicators and badges across the application.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Used font weights, color, and spacing to establish a clear visual hierarchy in the table.

### Interactive Elements
- **Row Interaction**: Made entire rows clickable to view details, improving the user experience particularly on larger screens.
- **Explicit Actions**: Added explicit action buttons (View icon) for cases where touch precision is needed or when the clickable row concept is not obvious.
- **State Transitions**: Added visual feedback for hover and active states to improve perceived responsiveness.
- **Loading States**: Enhanced loading states with animation and clear messaging to provide better feedback during data fetching.

### Detail Views
- **Dialog Pattern**: Used the dialog pattern for showing details rather than navigating to a new page, maintaining context and allowing for quick viewing and dismissal.
- **Organized Sections**: Grouped related information into clear sections (Contact Info, Lead Details, Assignment) to make details easier to scan.
- **Rich Formatting**: Used icons, badges, and proper date formatting to make information more scannable and meaningful.
- **Responsive Layout**: Implemented a responsive grid layout that adapts well to different screen sizes.

### Implementation Pattern
- **Component Separation**: Created a separate LeadDetails component that can be reused in different contexts rather than embedding the details view directly in the table.
- **State Management**: Used local state for UI-specific concerns (selected lead, dialog open state) rather than global state.
- **Consistent Props Pattern**: Established a consistent pattern for dialog components with `open`, `onOpenChange`, and content props.
- **Type Sharing**: Exported the Lead interface from the details component to ensure consistency and avoid duplication.

### UX Considerations
- **Empty States**: Created informative empty states with helpful guidance rather than just saying "No data."
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Implemented progressive disclosure by showing essential information in the table and full details in the dialog.
- **Interaction Stops**: Used `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent the row click when clicking specific action buttons within the row.
- **Visual Feedback**: Used color and iconography consistently to indicate status, with badges for categorical data and clear typography for text data.

### Performance Optimization
- **Conditional Rendering**: Used conditional rendering for table columns to avoid rendering hidden columns.
- **Dialog Rendering**: Only rendered the dialog content when it's open, reducing unnecessary DOM elements.
- **Visual Stability**: Maintained visual stability by defining explicit widths for certain columns to prevent layout shifts during filtering and sorting.

## Data Table Pagination Implementation

### Pagination Strategy
- **Client-Side vs Server-Side**: Implemented client-side pagination for this application since the total dataset size is manageable. For larger datasets, consider server-side pagination with API limit/offset parameters.
- **Page Size Selection**: Fixed the page size at 10 items per page for simplicity. For more flexibility, consider adding a dropdown to let users customize the number of items per page.
- **Stateful Pagination**: Used React state to track the current page, allowing users to navigate through pages without losing context.

### Pagination UI Patterns
- **Navigation Controls**: Implemented both numbered pages and next/previous buttons to support different navigation preferences.
- **Visual Feedback**: Added clear visual indicators for the current page and disabled states for unavailable navigation options.
- **Adaptive Page Numbers**: Created a smart pagination display that shows relevant page numbers based on the current page position, with ellipses for skipped ranges.
- **Consistent Positioning**: Placed pagination controls directly below the table for intuitive discovery and access.

### State Management Considerations
- **Filter Interaction**: Automatically reset to the first page when search terms or filters change to avoid showing empty results when the filtered dataset becomes smaller.
- **Context Preservation**: Maintained filter and search context when navigating between pages to provide a consistent user experience.
- **Efficient Updates**: Used slice operations on the filtered dataset rather than creating new arrays to optimize performance.

### Performance Optimizations
- **Render Optimization**: Only rendered the visible page items instead of the entire dataset, reducing DOM elements and improving performance.
- **Calculation Caching**: Calculated pagination values only when dependencies change to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Added conditional logic to only show pagination controls when there are items to paginate.

### Accessibility Considerations
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensured that pagination controls are keyboard accessible for users who don't use a mouse.
- **Semantic Structure**: Used appropriate HTML elements for pagination to ensure screen readers can properly interpret the controls.
- **Visual and Interactive States**: Added clear visual states for hover, focus, active, and disabled conditions to improve usability.

### Implementation Lessons
- **Independent Pagination Logic**: Separated pagination logic from filtering logic to maintain clear separation of concerns.
- **Reset Patterns**: Established clear rules for when pagination should reset to avoid user confusion.
- **Feedback Clarity**: Updated table captions to clearly indicate which portion of the total results are being displayed.
- **Maintainable Approach**: Implemented pagination in a way that doesn't require changing the core data structure, making it easier to maintain and extend.

## Dynamic Custom Fields with SugarCRM Mapping

### Implementation Pattern
- **Field Mapping Flexibility**: Implemented a system that allows users to add custom fields to the intake form on-the-fly and specify which SugarCRM fields they map to.
- **Dynamic Form Structure**: Used React state to manage custom fields with their types, values, and SugarCRM field mappings.
- **Modal Interface**: Created an intuitive modal interface for adding custom fields with options for different field types (text, number, select, checkbox, radio).

### Benefits
- **Adaptability**: The solution enables quick adaptation to changing business requirements without code changes.
- **CRM Integration**: Direct mapping to SugarCRM fields ensures data consistency across systems.
- **User Empowerment**: Form administrators can extend the form themselves without developer intervention.

### Technical Implementation
- **Custom Field Type**: Defined a comprehensive interface for custom fields that includes:
  ```typescript
  interface CustomField {
    id: string;
    label: string;
    type: "text" | "number" | "select" | "checkbox" | "radio";
    value: string;
    sugarCrmField: string;
    options?: string[];
  }
  ```
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Implemented conditional rendering based on field type (text inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons).
- **State Management**: Used React's useState for managing both the form's custom fields and the UI state for adding new fields.

### Integration with SugarCRM
- **Direct Field Mapping**: Each custom field includes a `sugarCrmField` property that specifies the exact SugarCRM API field name.
- **Dynamic API Payload**: When submitting to SugarCRM, the system dynamically builds the payload by including all custom fields with their mapped field names.
- **Storage**: Custom fields are stored in Supabase along with standard fields, preserving the complete form structure.

### UI/UX Considerations
- **Field Type Selection**: Provided appropriate input types for different data requirements (text, number, select, etc.).
- **Field Removal**: Allowed for easy removal of custom fields with clear visual indicators.
- **Field Mapping Display**: Showed the SugarCRM field mapping in the UI to maintain transparency.
- **Validation**: Ensured proper validation for custom field entries before submission.

### Lessons Learned
- **Schema Flexibility**: Building a dynamic schema that accommodates custom fields allowed the form to grow organically with business needs.
- **API Adaptability**: Systems that interact with external APIs (like SugarCRM) benefit from flexible field mapping rather than hardcoded structures.
- **User Feedback**: Providing immediate visual feedback for custom field additions improved the user experience.
- **Maintainability**: Despite adding complexity, the dynamic field system actually improved maintainability by reducing the need for code changes when form requirements evolve.

### Future Considerations
- **Field Templates**: Consider implementing saved templates for commonly used custom fields.
- **Field Validation**: Add more sophisticated validation options for custom fields.
- **Field Dependencies**: Implement conditional logic between custom fields (show/hide based on other field values).
- **Persistence**: Save custom field configurations for reuse across multiple form submissions.
- **Importing Existing Fields**: Add functionality to import field definitions directly from SugarCRM's schema.

## Custom Fields in Form Submissions

### UI Persistence for Custom Fields

- **Problem**: After form submission, custom fields would disappear from the UI until page refresh, creating a poor user experience for agents.
- **Root Cause**: The `resetForm()` function was clearing all custom fields, including persistent ones that should remain on the form after submission.
- **Solution**: Modified the `resetForm()` function to preserve persistent custom fields after submission by:
  1. Filtering out the persistent custom fields before reset
  2. Restoring those fields with empty values after form submission
  3. Maintaining field definitions and properties while only clearing entered values

### Implementation:
```typescript
const resetForm = () => {
  // Save the current custom fields that are persistent before resetting
  const persistentCustomFields = formData.customFields.filter(field => field.isPersistent);
  
  setFormData({
    // ... reset other form fields ...
    
    // Restore the persistent custom fields with empty values
    customFields: persistentCustomFields.map(field => ({
      ...field,
      value: "" // Reset the value while keeping the field definition
    })),
  });
};
```

### Lessons:
- When implementing multi-session persistence features, consider the user experience across the entire form lifecycle (initialization, data entry, submission, reset)
- Always preserve configuration data (like field definitions) after form submissions while only clearing user-entered values
- For complex form states, handle each part of the state independently with clear separation between configuration and user data
